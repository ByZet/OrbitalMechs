# OrbitalMechs
This project demonstrates orbital mechanics by solving Kepler's equation to calculate the true anomaly of celestial objects. It uses the NASA JPL Horizons API to retrieve orbital elements, applies iterative numerical methods for computation, and visualizes results in a user-friendly GUI built with Tkinter.
